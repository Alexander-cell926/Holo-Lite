1.Run it: python holo_brain.py

It starts smart: It already knows English, Spanish, and Python because of the "Bootstrap" function I added.

Test it: Type def main(): return 0 -> It will say PYTHON.

Teach it:

2.Type: /train Japanese Konnichiwa watashi wa ai desu

3.Type: /train Japanese Arigato gozaimasu

4.Now test: Konnichiwa -> It will say JAPANESE.

5.Save it: Type /save. It creates a file. Next time you run it, it remembers Japanese.

This is a fully functional, persistent AI engine in a single file. Enjoy experimenting!
